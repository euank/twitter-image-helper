A webextension to make opening twitter images easier from twitter-web

## Can you seriously not figure out how to right-click -> view image?

Haha, very funny.

At the time of writing, multi-image galleries on ｔｗｉｔｔｅｒ ｄｏｔ ｃｏｍ do not have that right click menu option because they cover the entire image with a div.

I also don't like opening them from the pre-gallery view because I usually
don't know I want to open an image until I've already seen the full thing, not
just the thumbnail.

Also, the preview image isn't always full size (`:orig` vs `:thumb`).

## Gif demo?

But of course. Here's how I used to open images before this extension, and how I do it now that I've got it.

The scenario is that I click on a gallery, and then decide I want to copy the second image.
